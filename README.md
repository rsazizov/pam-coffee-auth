# pam-torch-auth

pam-torch-auth is a sample PAM module that uses PyTorch to authenticate user based on 
webcam image. Here I use EfficientNet to check that user has his coffee mug before he
can authenticate, but in theory you can do anything that you can in PyTorch  (e.g. face recognition,
voice verification).
